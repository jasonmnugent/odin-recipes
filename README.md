This is my first ever coding project. The primary goal is to apply what I've learned about HTML so far in The Odin Project. I created a basic website that contains some basic recipes.

I built the site to contain relative hyperlink references that navigate you to different pages for different recipes. Each page contains a mix of headers, images, text that is emphasized, and a mix of ordered/unordered lists that contain ingredients and directions for each meal.
